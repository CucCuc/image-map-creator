# Image Map Creator

This is a simple map creator tool made with the p5.js library. I want it
to be easy to use for both the end user and the developper.

## What you can do

- [x] drag&drop a picture on the canvas
- [x] draw rectangle areas
- [x] set the desired url of an area

## What you will be able to do (maybe)

- [ ] draw circular areas
- [ ] draw polygon areas
- [ ] show a area-menu by right clicking on an area

## How to use it

See the example html file in the examples folder. (It's really easy IMO)
